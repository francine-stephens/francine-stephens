ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my Github! My name is Francine Stephens. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at Stanford University. My research spans a wide array of topics - education, environmental justice, neighborhood change, political infrastructure, and crime - but the overarching motivation behind my projects is a passion for using geospatial data to address applied geographic and geospatial problems from drawing borders and boundaries to facility siting to resource allocation.

Previously, I have served as the GIS/Spatial Data Analyst for the Texas Democratic Party during the 2020 General Election cycle and as a research associate for NORC at the University of Chicago and the Consortium for Policy Research in Education. Outside of work, I love spending time with my family, exercising, cooking vegan food, reading, and avidly following the NBA, especially the San Antonio Spurs and Denver Nuggets.
