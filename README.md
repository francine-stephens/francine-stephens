ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my Github! My name is Francine Stephens. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at Stanford University. My research spans a wide array of topics - education, environmental justice, neighborhood change, political infrastructure, and crime - but the overarching motivation behind my projects is a passion for using geospatial data to address applied geographic and geospatial problems from drawing borders and boundaries to facility siting to resource allocation.

In previous lives, I have served as the GIS/Spatial Data Analyst for the Texas Democratic Party during the 2020 General Election cycle and as research associate for NORC at the University of Chicago and the Consortium for Policy Research in Education. Outside of work, I love hanging with my family, exercising, cooking vegan food, reading, and avidly following the NBA, especially the San Antonio Spurs and Philadelphia 76ers.
